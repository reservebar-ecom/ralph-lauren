                Ordering from Ralph Lauren’s ReserveBar eBoutique is super easy! When you’ve decided what product you’d
                like to purchase, click the BUY NOW button next to it and enter in your store’s address to check
                availability. If the product is available, you can select the size and hit the ADD TO CART button. The
                product will then be in your Cart, and you can either checkout or continue shopping. Once you enter your
                address for one product, it will automatically populate that address for the other products when you hit
                BUY NOW.

            </h2>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                You should use your Ralph Lauren store’s address as the delivery location.

                How do I order a product if it’s unavailable?
            </h2>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                Because ReserveBar works with an extensive network of retailers who provide real-time inventory, product
                availability varies by retailer and some products may not be available to you. If a product you’d like
                to
                purchase is unavailable at your inputted address, please contact our Concierge Team at
                concierge@reservebar.com.

                How do I pay?
            </h2>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                When you go to Checkout, input your Store Code into the Gift Card field and hit the APPLY button to
                calculate your budget.

                What if it asks me to put in a Credit Card?
            </h2>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                If your Store Code does not zero out the order and you are prompted to enter your payment method
                information, most likely your order exceeds your budget allotment for the month. Try reducing your order
                to
                coincide with your remaining budget and checkout again. If the problem persists or you have questions,
                please contact your Ralph Lauren Manager, as well as our Concierge Team at concierge@reservebar.com.

                How are online alcohol orders fulfilled?
            </h2>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                In the United States, federal law mandates a three-tiered system of alcohol distribution. The first
                tier,
                who are the producers or importers of alcohol products, can only sell to the second tier, who are
                wholesale
                distributors. This second tier can only sell to the third tier, who are licensed retailers, and only the
                third tier can sell alcohol products to the public.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                When you place an order for an alcohol product online, the order is sent to a licensed retailer (i.e.
                the
                third tier) to be fulfilled. If the selected retailer does not have the needed product in stock, they
                may
                need to wait for a shipment from the wholesale distributor (i.e. the second tier), who may in turn need
                to
                wait for a shipment from the producer or importer of the product (i.e. the first tier). When a
                ReserveBar
                order does not ship at the expected time, a delay at the first or second tier of this three-tiered
                system is
                often the reason.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-4 text-lg my-2">
                When the retailer has the needed product(s), they ship your order via ground shipping. Most orders ship
                in
                1-2 business days, but please note they may take longer.

                An order confirmation is emailed to you automatically when your order is placed. If the email is not
